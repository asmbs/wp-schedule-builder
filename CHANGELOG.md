### 1.4.2
- Set the data-import version to squash bugs

### 1.4.1
#### Bugfixes

### 1.4.0
#### Updates
- Separated session taxonomy filters in the schedule grid builder to allow more complex query logicâ€”specifically, ANDing societies and ORing other terms.

#### Bugfixes
- Fixed a few places where missing or invalid session date/time data slipped through the cracks and caused crashes.

### 1.3.5
#### Bugfixes
- Fixed a field reference error causing sessions with _no_ progress markers selected to be marked as complete.

### 1.3.4

Literally, three minutes. Come on.

#### Bugfixes
- Fixed an error in the start/end time query modifications from 1.3.3.

#### Updates
- Added composer version badges to readme, because why not.

### 1.3.3
#### Bugfixes
- Fixed a [strict-standards error](https://github.com/asmbs/wp-schedule-builder/issues/1) in variable passing.
- Modified the day start/end time calculation queries to [omit blank and unpublished results](https://github.com/asmbs/wp-schedule-builder/issues/2).

### 1.3.2
#### Bugfixes
- Added checks to handle blank dates and times in sessions and their agendas.

### 1.3.1
#### Bugfixes
- The import writers' `addMeta` and `addTerm` methods now ignore any empty values.

#### Updates
- When errors occur during an import, up to 10 of those errors will be listed on the import results page.

### 1.3.0
#### Updates
- Added the ability to round day start/end times to the appropriate nearest hour (_floor_ for start time, _ceiling_ for end time).
- Updated the default string format for day start/end methods to return the time instead of the date.

### 1.2.0
#### Updates
- Added counting methods to both the full-schedule listing and per-day listings.

### 1.1.0
